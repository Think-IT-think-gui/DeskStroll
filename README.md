=============================> Current Project <==================================

The motive bhind this project is to make the use of the windows os simple and 
interactive for a user to focuse on what's to be done at a time....

Since this programe was made mostly in tkinter, it adaptation to screen resolution 
is poor so for anyone who want to run this codes, 
your machine is to support a resolution of 1280x1024 resolution or you will not be
able to get the GUI at its peak.

==============================> Future projects <==================================

i am currently working on a desktop web app, which has a ui pannel for the server 
and allows the user to manage all clients, also allows personal chat between 
clients and also allowes general posting of files , this program woun't need a
browser to perform it's functions.
======> Imports <=======
